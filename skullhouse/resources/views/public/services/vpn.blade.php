	<h1><span>Services | VPN</span></h1>
	<hr>
	<p>
	Phi Kappa Sigma Delta Phi chapter offers all past and current<br>
	members access to a Virtual Private Network (VPN), in order<br>
	to allow for secure transmission of data wherever our<br>
	brothers are in the world.
	</p>

	<p>
	This service is provided in the hopes of helping brothers gain access<br>
	to the internet without fear of having that information sniffed or<br>
	spied upon by third parties, whether from simple malicious users,<br>
	or governmental agencies.
	</p>

	<p>
	We believe in the ideals of freedom and privacy in the digital age, and<br>
	will not willingly allow ANY third parties access to the information<br>
	that this service will be used for.
	</p>

	<p>
	In the case of a governmental subpeona for information on this<br>
	server or its members, this server's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary"><span>Warrant Canary</span></a>,<br>
	located <a href="/canary/"><span>here</span></a><br>
	will die, and a grace period will be issued to all members if<br>
	allowed, before this server is shut down and has its data shredded<br>
	to maintain the anonymity of its users.
	</p>

	<p>This page will be updated on August 25th 2015 with more details on this service</p>
