	<h1><span>Services | Forum</span></h1>
	<hr>
	<p>
	In this digital age, a place online where members can come<br>
	together in order to share their experience is vital for a<br>
	holistic experience for all members.
	</p>

	<p>
	Thus a forum is available for all past, current, and future<br>
	members. Alumni and current members will be able to have a<br>
	common point of discussions, and potential future members<br>
	will be able to ask questions in a safe environment to glean<br>
	an idea of what it means to be in this brotherhood
	</p>

	<p>This page will be updated on August 25th 2015 with more details on this service</p>
