	As a service to all past and current members, this server will<br>
	act as a photography repository, allowing for the original<br>
	photos that members take to be stored for posterity, and<br>
	to act as a backup in case of hardware/software failure.
	</p>

	<p>This page will be updated on August 25th 2015 with more details on this service</p>
