	<h1><span>CORE VALUES</span></h1>
	<hr>

	<p>
	We commit to the value of <b><span>Trust</span></b>, the foundation of a<br>
	relationship based on a belief in oneself as well as others, which is<br>
	earned and strengthened through experience. The value of trust is<br>
	found in our reliance on each other and enables an open comfort in<br>
	interacting with fellow Skulls.
	</p>

	<p>
	We commit to the value of <b><span>Honor</span></b>, staying true to a set of higher<br>
	standards and morals in the face of adversity. Membership in Phi Kappa<br>
	Sigma means a commitment to leading an honorable life.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
 	We commit to the value of <b><span>Respect</span></b>, which begins with yourself<br>
	and the practice of the golden rule, “Do unto others as you would have<br>
	them do unto you.” This statement is the acceptance of the ideals of<br>
	others.  In order to move forward as a brotherhood, we must continue to<br>
	consider each other’s points of view.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	We commit to the value of <b><span>Knowledge</span></b>, the acquisition of<br>
	thought, theory, and principles following in the footsteps of our<br>
	Founding Fathers in accordance with our oath of Brotherhood.  With<br>
	this knowledge we will come closer to self-discovery, the improvement<br>
	of society, and the translation of knowledge into power.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	We commit to the value of <b><span>Wisdom</span></b>, a virtue gained through<br>
	experiences of self and others.  Wisdom is the application of knowledge<br>
	and past experiences to make decisions regardless of the situation.<br>
	Through sharing wisdom, a bond is formed between young and old,<br>
	teacher and student; this bond is what brings us together.
	</p>

	<p>
	We commit to the value of <b><span>Responsibility</span></b>, by being reliable in<br>
	the fulfillment of the objectives of our Fraternity and our personal<br>
	obligations, enduring the consequences of our actions.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	We commit to the value of <b><span>Integrity</span></b>, our inner foundation for<br>
	holding true to our values of trust, honor, respect, knowledge, wisdom,<br>
	and responsibility that guide us in living a life of virtue.<br>
