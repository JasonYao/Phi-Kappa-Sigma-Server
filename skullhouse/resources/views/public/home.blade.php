	<hr>

	<p>Dear Prospective Skull,</p>

	<p>
		It is an honor that you are considering joining the Delta Phi<br>
		Chapter of the Phi Kappa Sigma Fraternity at New York University.<br>
		Skullhouse is always looking for socially adventurous and<br>
		intellectually curious members, and we look forward to making<br>
		your acquaintance!
	</p>

	<p>
		Despite the academic rigors of one of the nation’s most outstanding universities, the brothers of 
		Phi Kappa Sigma have not only endured, but have thrived, finding success in their coursework 
		and extracurricular activities. Like New York City itself, we are truly a diverse and cosmopolitan 
		band of brothers — it’s almost a guarantee that someone in the Chapter shares your interest.  
	</p>

	<p>
		The <a href="/brothers/">brothers</a> of Skullhouse are varsity sportsmen, first chair violinists, leaders in the university’s 
		developer and technology communities, filmmakers, volunteer museum guides, avid sailors, and 
		public policy case competitors. This summer, brothers secured internships developing apps for 
		Microsoft, investigating campaign finance in DC, and consulting businesses for Pricewaterhouse 
		Coopers. Our members come from as far away as Nanjing and as close as the Bronx. 
	</p>

	<p>
		We are excited for recruitment this semester and invite you to be a part of the most tight-knit 
		brotherhood on campus. To take the first step, please 
		register for recruitment
		with the Interfraternity Council. To learn more about Skullhouse’s “Billiards and Jazz,” “Fratapult,” and 
		“Soccer and Frisbee” <a href="/events/">recruitment events</a>, 
		join our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/RushSkullhouseNYU/">Facebook group</a>. And of course, please browse 
		this website — it’s a treasure trove of information! 
	</p>

	<p>
		Welcome (back) to campus! Here’s to the start of a great year. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Sincerely,<br>
		Bob Gardner<br>
		President, Phi Kappa Sigma
