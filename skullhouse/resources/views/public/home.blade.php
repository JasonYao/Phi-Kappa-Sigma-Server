	<p>
		Dear <span>Prospective Skull</span>,
	</p>
	<p>
		It is an honor that you are considering joining the Delta Phi chapter of the Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity here at NYU.
		Phi Kappa Sigma is a social fraternity that is looking for intellectual, outgoing, and adventurous students to join its ranks.
		Skulls are very involved on campus. Athletics are very important to the brothers-
		for example, <a href="/brothers/JasonYao/">Jason</a> and <a href="/brothers/ColinSherman/">Colin</a> compete on NYU’s fencing team while <a href="/brothers/WilliamGockel-Figge/">Will</a> competes on the wrestling team.
		In the past year, NYU has awarded our chapter for the <span>highest GPA of any social fraternity</span>, most improved chapter, best risk management, and <span>excellence in values</span>.
		The brothers here have had an excellent summer, from working on campaign finance in DC and travelling around Europe, to interning at Microsoft and PricewaterhouseCoopers - we’re all rested and ready for a great school year.
	</p>
	<p>
		We are excited for recruitment this semester and look forward to meeting you.
		The recruitment process begins with you <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/nyu.edu/forms/d/16WKx2eI0_wSfFgQGKUr4UOI7UMipO-51YydFG3-tv3s/viewform">registering for recruitment</a>

		To all the freshmen and transfer students on campus, congratulations on enrolling at NYU. We are excited to have you on campus and are looking forward to helping to make NYU and New York City your new home.<br>
		Here’s to the start of a great year.

	<p>
