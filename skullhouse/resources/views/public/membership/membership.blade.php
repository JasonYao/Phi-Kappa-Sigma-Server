	<h1><span>MEMBERSHIP</span></h1>
	<hr>

	<p>
	Skullhouse is keen to welcome into membership all men of good
	character who share a common interest in our Core Values, so that
	we can work together to further our objectives and to provide
	mutual support to each other as members of the brotherhood.
  </p>

  <p>
  We feel that it is important to stress potential applicants certain<br>
  characteristics of Skullhouse.  We do this to help inquirers reach an<br>
  informed decision about pursuing membership in our lifelong organization.
  </p>

  <p>
  Firstly, we draw your attention to the Constitution and Acts of Phi<br>
  Kappa Sigma International Fraternity, <a href="/PKSConstitution2014.pdf"><span>available here in PDF</span></a>.<br>

  <ul>
    <li><p><span>Article II</span> ("Membership")</p></li>

  </ul>

  <p>
  If you are interested in joining the Skullhouse, then please also take<br>
